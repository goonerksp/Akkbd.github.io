        This day, 03 September meant nothing to me before akka. For people who do not know, Satwika is my sister.
        At first I did not know that she is, the first few days I stumbled upon her existence, I hated herðŸ˜‚. But 
        I was so wrong, ever since I started talking to her, I know I felt a strong connection with her.
        I started calling her my Akka from January 6th, before we knew we were long cousins when I got added to her list of thammusðŸ˜‚.

        Since then I had no clue, that I'd grow this fond of her, I mean I just thought that yeah I made a friend, that's it.
        Who knew that I can love someone so much, like a family, in just a short period of 1 1/2 years?
        She was the only one who knew I was in grave depression, she helped me out by just being there for me, for talking
        about my insecurities, for support, for knocking sense into my head. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I dont know when I came out of depression, but it was relieving. I always was and still am afraid that I might lose her
        cause god knows how much she means to me but we ALWAYS fight, like alwaysðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚, she's a donkie that's why.
