    Hey akka, I know this website looks a bit tacky, I mean I don't know if you'll like this website, but I sure as hell wanted to make it. Happy birthday akka you have no idea how much you mean to me.
    I always wanted a sister, you know like always. I mean I have a wonderful brother who's the best but I always wanted an Akka, and you know the twin story. Anyway, the first time I talked to you, that's when I knew you were something special.
    Listen akka, the thing you don't know about yourself is that you make yourself very memorable, that is the reason why people do not forget you, and you did that very much to me as well. You won this stupid brother's heart, calling you my akka has been one of
    the biggest pleasures of my life. The time I spent with you, however in length it may be, I'll cherish until I last. You're my harshest critic, my trusted confidant, my veracious guide, my biggest fan, my best friend, and certainly the most important, my big sister.
  </p>
    The memories I made with you, all the fights we had, all the poems I wrote for you, all the times you were there for me even when I didn't ask, all the times we looked out for each other. They will always be rooted into my heart, I will never forget them and I know you
    definitely wont. Honestly, Akka you being in my life, is a gift from god. Seeing you happy, is what I deeply and all I want. I modeled my life around you, picking up little pieces of your habits into mine, made me whole. You're one of the purest people I've seen in 
    my life, you never ever lie a thing which I admire the most. I want you to have the best birthday ever, hope this website is a step towards it.
  <p>
    Happy Birthday Akka, you are the best sister I could've ever asked for. Thank You, for ... Everything.
